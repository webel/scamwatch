# ScamWatch

> "We" is actually _me_, Cookie. I'm not quite organised, yet, jumping between actively analysing scam networks and writing a pre-installation tool. Stay tuned.

## Exposing a Scam Network in Real Time

We are in the trenches. **ScamWatch** is not just another passive database of phishing sitesâ€”itâ€™s an active effort to document, analyze, and disrupt a scam network that is at peak operation, consistently deploying new domains in an attempt to evade detection. This network is alive and adapting, and so are we.

We are pushing real-time evidence, capturing their tactics before they change, and ensuring their infrastructure is flagged, blacklisted, and ultimately dismantled.

## What We're Doing

- **Tracking and monitoring** newly deployed scam websites linked to a malicious infrastructure.
- **Capturing screenshots** and metadata before the domains are taken down or changed.
- **Connecting the dots** to expose the network behind these fraudulent operations.
- **Pushing for blacklisting** by reporting findings to cybersecurity authorities and registrars.
- **Open collaboration**â€”anyone can contribute evidence, help analyze, and take action.

## Why This Matters

These scams arenâ€™t just a nuisance. They exploit victims through fake task-based earnings schemes, phishing pages, and financial fraud. By acting fast and sharing data openly, we aim to disrupt the cycle and get these domains shut down before they can do more harm.

## How You Can Help

- **Report new scam sites**: Open an issue or submit findings via PR.
- **Help with research**: Investigate connections between domains and infrastructure.
- **Contribute automation tools**: Improve our tracking and detection capabilities.
- **Spread awareness**: Share our findings to prevent more victims.
