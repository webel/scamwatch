      <h1>Suspected Scam Websites â€“ Investigation & Screenshots</h1>
      <section>
        <p>
          This page documents a collection of
          <span class="highlight">suspected scam websites</span> associated with
          the IP address <span class="highlight">104.18.21.48</span>. These
          domains were identified through VirusTotal's resolution records. While
          not all have been explicitly linked to fraudulent activities
          <b>yet</b>, the IP itself connected to suspicious activity, and we aim
          to get these frontends blacklisted over time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our investigation began with
          <span class="highlight">lezzateg.com</span>, a phishing website that
          deceives victims into performing fake
          <span class="highlight">"tasks"</span> under the promise of payment.
          Victims believe they are earning money through legitimate work, only
          to be asked for fees or personal details, leaving them empty-handed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Further analysis of the hosting infrastructure uncovered additional
          domains operating under the same IP. We are providing visual
          documentation to show that these websites are interconnected and
          likely part of the same scam network.
        </p>
